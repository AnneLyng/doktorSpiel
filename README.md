This repository contains a survival game developed for aspiring or full fledged doctors. 

The game aims to provide a better understanding of common metrics from (statistical) survival analysis.

The set-up is much inspired from the following Shiny Dashboard:
[the OpenFDA dashboard](http://www.statwonk.com/openfda-dashboard/).
